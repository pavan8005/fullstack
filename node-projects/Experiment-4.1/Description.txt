Title
CLI Employee Management System Using Node.js and Arrays

Project Description
This project is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application built with Node.js.
It manages employee records in memory using arrays. Users can interact with the application to add employees,
view all employees, and remove employees by ID. The project uses Node.js’
built-in readline module to capture user input interactively in the terminal.

Steps 
1. Initialize Project – Create a Node.js project and set up a index.js file.
2. Set Up Readline Module – Use Node’s built-in readline to capture user input from the terminal.
3. Create Employee Array – Store employee records (with id and name) in an in-memory array.
4. Add Employee Functionality – Prompt user to enter an employee’s ID and name, then save it in the array.
5. List Employees – Display all employees stored in the array.
6. Remove Employee – Allow the user to remove an employee by ID.
7. Interactive Menu – Build a simple menu loop so the user can choose actions until they exit.
