Title
REST API for Playing Card Collection Using Express.js

Project Description
This project is about building a RESTful API using Express.js to manage a collection of playing cards.
 The API allows clients to perform CRUD-like operations such as listing all cards,
  adding new cards, retrieving specific cards by ID, and deleting cards. Data will be stored in a 
  simple in-memory array for ease of implementation.

Steps 
1. Initialize Project – Create a Node.js project (npm init -y) and install Express (npm install express).
2. Set Up Express Server – Create a basic Express.js server in index.js that listens on a port.
3. Create In-Memory Data Store – Use an array to store playing card objects (e.g., { id, suit, value }).

Implement Routes

GET /cards → List all cards.
POST /cards → Add a new card with suit and value.
GET /cards/:id → Retrieve a card by its unique ID.
DELETE /cards/:id → Remove a card by ID.

4. Handle Input Validation – Ensure suit and value are provided when adding a card.
5. Return JSON Responses – All responses should be in JSON format with clear success/error messages.
6. Test API – Use Postman or cURL to test endpoints and verify behavior.
