Title
ProductCard Component Using Props

This just means
We are going to make a React component called ProductCard.
It will show product details like name, price, and stock status.
Instead of hardcoding the data inside the component, we will use props.
Props = data we send into a component from outside.
This will help us learn how to make reusable components in React.

step by step

1. Create a new React project (Vite or Create React App).
2. Inside src/components/, create a file named ProductCard.jsx.
3. In ProductCard, accept props: name, price, inStock.
4. Display these props in a card-like box. 

Example:
Product Name: Phone
Price: $500
Status: In Stock

5. Style the box with a border, padding, and margin so it looks neat.
6. In App.jsx, import ProductCard.
7. Render multiple ProductCard components with different data.

Example:

<ProductCard name="Laptop" price="$1200" inStock={true} />
<ProductCard name="Headphones" price="$100" inStock={false} />

8. Each card will display data based on props, without changing the ProductCard code.

Learning Outcomes

Props → A way to pass data into components.
Reusability → One component can display different products just by changing props.
Dynamic rendering → UI updates based on the values passed in.
Component design → Separating code into small, reusable parts.
