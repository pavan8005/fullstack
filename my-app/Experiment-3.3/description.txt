Title:
Person Class Hierarchy with Student and Teacher Subclasses
This just means we are going to create a main class called Person and then create two smaller classes, Student and Teacher, that come from it.

We want to learn inheritance in JavaScript.
Inheritance = when one class (child) can use the properties and methods of another class (parent).
This is an important part of object-oriented programming (OOP).
Person is the parent (base) class.
Student and Teacher are child (sub) classes.

step by step:

1. Create a Person class
2. It has some properties like name and age.
3. It has a method (function) to show this information.
4. Create a Student class (child of Person)
5. It has everything a Person has (name, age).
6. Plus one extra property like grade or course.
7. It has its own method that shows name, age, and grade.
8. Create a Teacher class (child of Person)
9. It has everything a Person has (name, age).
10. Plus one extra property like subject or department.
11. It has its own method that shows name, age, and subject.
12. Test the classes
13. Make one object of Student and one object of Teacher.
14. Call their methods to check how they display details.

Learning Outcomes

Base class → a general blueprint (Person).
Subclasses → more specific versions (Student, Teacher).
Inheritance → Student and Teacher automatically get Person’s features.
Overriding methods → Student and Teacher can change or add to Person’s method.
